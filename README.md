# Vocabulary on the Fly

Traveling can be long, but productive. This program proposes the user:

- Selection of a list of words among a list of files. This is perfect for weekly vocabulary assignments at elementary school.  
- Selection of a number of those words to be pulled randomly depending on the length of the challenge desired.  
- Logging of score to track how well went the assignment globally.  

To run this program, the user needs to install *QPython3* app from *Google Play*. Then, content from this repository can be copied as a project in the folders of the app. Finally, the user can add any `.txt` file with list of words he desires to the *data* folder to customize words available when the program is launched.
